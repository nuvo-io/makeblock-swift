# Swift API for interacting with Makeblock Robots

This is a "clone" of the project [Makeblock-Swift](https://github.com/Makeblock-official/Makeblock-Swift/blob/master/LICENSE) out of the [Makeblock GitHub](https://github.com/Makeblock-official/) home.

Hopefully this will be merged back into the main project, but at the present time the main difference is that this is now Swift 3.0 compatible and fixed a few warning.
